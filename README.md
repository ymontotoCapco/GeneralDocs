# GeneralDocs

GeneralDocs is a rolling repo of the markdown files I create to help myself and other developers learn the tips and tricks of Xcode and Swift/SwiftUI/Obj-C programming.

## Documentation Available

- [Debugging](https://github.com/ymontotoCapco/GeneralDocs/tree/main/Documentation/Debugging)
  - [Xcode Debugging](https://github.com/ymontotoCapco/GeneralDocs/blob/89ff03371eb2f522127d00a10c7a43b08e3fe3a8/Documentation/Debugging/XcodeDebugging.md)

## Why
Normally, as developers we can pick up habits on how to code, and effective tools to make our jobs easier. As we learn new techniques, we tend to forget the ones that work best and some which are even best practices. This repo serves as a guide on approaching situations like these and techniques that might help you out when you cant remember the exact method to solving your issue.

<br>

This list is not complete - nor do I expect to ever have all the tools needed to grow as a developer. If you find some contributions along the way, please feel free to open a PR and see how you can help your fellow developers.
